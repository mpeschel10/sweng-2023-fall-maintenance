### Next
All UI stuff, all the time. Just throw a bunch of buttons on HTML documents.
maintenance interface: view ticket, update status

manager interface: browse tenant (search not explicitly required)
manager interface: view tenant, set tenant apartment, delete tenant.
manager interface: create tenant

implement tenant interface: submit ticket
implement maintenance inteface: browse, search, by apartment number, by area (like kitchen), by date range, and by status.

### Later
tenant INT, << server
apartment VARCHAR(255), << server
datetime BIGINT, << server
status 'PENDING' << server
photo preview

submit forms with javascript

Take screenshots for each functionality.
Push your code to your Github repo, and submit the link.

### Maybe
tenant interface: search. Not mandatory, but would be good to have and I think it will be easy to implement as a subset of maintenance search
css (I have a 90 rn; worthwhile if I have the time)
upload photos on same page as make new request
multi photos?
nice search
don't allow filename clobbering
make filenames url safe
    md5?
