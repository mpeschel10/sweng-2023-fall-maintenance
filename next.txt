photo preview

submit forms with javascript

Take screenshots for each functionality.
Push your code to your Github repo, and submit the link.

### Maybe
tenant interface: search. Not mandatory, but would be good to have and I think it will be easy to implement as a subset of maintenance search
css (I have a 90 rn; worthwhile if I have the time)
upload photos on same page as make new request
multi photos?
nice search
don't allow filename clobbering
make filenames url safe
    md5?
