* Tenant can submit request, setting location, description, photograph.
You may assume:
• A tenant may not rent more than one apartment at a time.
• A tenant can only request the maintenance of their apartment.
• A request can only contain one problem. If there is more than one problem, the tenant must submit separate requests.
• request photo
• request ID auto
request date/time auto
• request status initially ‘pending’

submit forms with javascript


Maintenance staff:
FR2: A staff member must be able to browse all maintenance requests, with a variety of filters: by apartment number, by area (like kitchen), by date range, and by status.
FR3: A staff member must be able to update the status of a selected request, from ‘pending’ to ‘completed’.
You may assume that a staff member cannot edit anything else of a request and cannot delete a request.

Manager:
FR4: A manager must be able to add a new tenant, move a tenant to another apartment, and delete a tenant. A tenant account consists of the following information: tenant ID, name, phone number, email, date of check-in, date of check-out, and an apartment number. You may assume that this system does not handle rent payments. So, there’s no information about payments

Take screenshots for each functionality.
Push your code to your Github repo, and submit the link.

### Maybe
multi photos?
don't allow filename clobbering
