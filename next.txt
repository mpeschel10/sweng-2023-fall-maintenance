### Next
implement tenant interface: submit ticket
    post endpoint: new ticket
    complete new ticket test
    redirect to success page with relevant ticket
    test creating new ticket manually

implement maintenance inteface: browse, search, by apartment number, by area (like kitchen), by date range, and by status.
implement maintenance interface: view ticket, update status
implement manager interface: browse tenant (search not explicitly required) view tenant, set tenant apartment, delete tenant.

### Later
tenant INT, << server
apartment VARCHAR(255), << server
datetime BIGINT, << server
status 'PENDING' << server
photo preview

submit forms with javascript

Take screenshots for each functionality.
Push your code to your Github repo, and submit the link.

### Maybe
tenant interface: search. Not mandatory, but would be good to have and I think it will be easy to implement as a subset of maintenance search
css (I have a 90 rn; worthwhile if I have the time)
upload photos on same page as make new request
multi photos?
nice search
don't allow filename clobbering
make filenames url safe
    md5?
remove ability for tenants to self-identify
knockoff-multer has a bug where a promise can be both resolved and rejected if e.g. there's multiple files or the file-write fails after the file data closes.
    use promise.all or whatever it's called to make sure everything succeeds.
Is it a bug that POST /image returns the paths to the client before files are all written?
    Call it a feature. Faster response.
